## ğŸš€ About This Project

This project is me flexing my employable data science skills in public.

Iâ€™m using the [Instacart 2017 dataset](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) to:
 Clean and explore over **3 million grocery orders** ğŸ§¼ğŸ“Š
 Build features that actually make sense ğŸ’¡
 Train a model that can **recommend groceries** youâ€™ll reorder ğŸ§ ğŸ›’

I love solving big data puzzles for fun and extracting SIGNAL from noise.
